    The Verify API helps you to implement 2FA (two-factor authentication) in your applications.
    This is useful for:


    * Protecting against spam, by preventing spammers from creating multiple accounts

    * Monitoring suspicious activity, by forcing an account user to verify ownership of a number

    * Ensuring that you can reach your users at any time because you have their correct phone number

        To use Verify request you:


        1. Create a request to send a verification code to your user.

        2. Check the `status` field in the response to ensure that your request
        was successful.
